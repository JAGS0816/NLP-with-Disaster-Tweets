# Disaster Tweets Classification Project

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook serving as a technical report for the project focused on classifying tweets as real disasters or non-disasters using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build and train a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture from scratch for tweet classification. The model aims to identify real disasters in social media by analyzing text data.

## Contents

- `Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data analysis, model development, and evaluation.

## Getting Started

To run the Jupyter Notebook locally, ensure you have Python and Jupyter installed. You can install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the notebook using:

```bash
jupyter notebook Natural%20Language%20Processing%20with%20Disaster%20Tweets.ipynb
```

## Future Enhancements

For future investigations, consider exploring:
- Incorporating emojis for additional contextual information.
- Evaluating the use of pre-trained classifiers for further optimization.
